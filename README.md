Dynamic Dropout Code

Three files are loaded. EDA.ipynb is covers the Exploratory Data Analysis on the dataset _Optical Recognition of Handwritten Digits_ by Alpaydin et al. (1998). This is loaded only as a reference file and is only if the user wants more information on the data used in my paper _Adaptive Dropout Rate Optimization for Neural Network Training_.

Assignment_Models.ipynb contains the code for both the MLP and Tensorflow models utilizing Dynamic Dropout as well as Static Dropout and no dropout. This notebook will generate weight arrays (MLP) or the TensorFlow models and save them for use in analysis.

Model Analysis.ipynb contains the logic for analyzing the data including heatmaps for activations for both TensorFlow and MLP. 

All code was written using Python 3.12.4.
TensorFlow version used was 2.16.2.
